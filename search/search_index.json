Critical information for operators\u2014for example, which driver is scheduled to serve a given trip, when and where to layover, or how deadheads should be completed\u2014is not included in GTFS at present.

The gap that exists between scheduling software and CAD/AVL software was identified by respondents as a major source of friction. Even as GTFS has seen increasingly widespread adoption, operational data is subject to proprietary formats, overlapping use cases, and manual processes that inefficiently transfer data from one system to another.
